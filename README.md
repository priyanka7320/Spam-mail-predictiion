# üìß Spam Email Prediction using Machine Learning

The main objective of this project is to **manage and predict spam messages** from the inbox.  
With the rise of phishing and fraud attempts, protecting confidential information has become more critical than ever.  
This spam prediction tool helps prevent data leakage and enhances email security.

## üéØ Objective
- Detect and classify **spam vs. non-spam emails**.
- Safeguard users from fraudsters trying to hack confidentiality.
- Provide a **real-world applicable solution** for secure communication.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tech Stack
- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **Libraries & Tools**:  
  - Scikit-learn  
  - Pandas  
  - NumPy  
  - NLTK / Text Preprocessing tools  
  - Matplotlib / Seaborn (for visualization)

## ü§ñ Machine Learning Workflow
1. **Data Pre-processing**  
   - Cleaned raw email/text data  
   - Tokenization, stopword removal, stemming/lemmatization  

2. **Feature Extraction**  
   - Used techniques like **TF-IDF** or **Count Vectorizer** to convert text into numerical features.  

3. **Model Training**  
   - Implemented various ML algorithms (e.g., Naive Bayes, Logistic Regression, SVM).  
   - Evaluated based on accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.  

4. **Prediction**  
   - Classified emails into **Spam** or **Not Spam**.

## üìà Results
- Successfully trained and tested models on the dataset.  
- Achieved reliable accuracy in detecting spam emails.  
- The best-performing algorithm was selected for real-world usage.
